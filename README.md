# Machine Learning Projects
# LinkedIN Profile Generator
Developed a professional image generation pipeline using OstrisAI Toolkit and Stable Diffusion by transforming casual user images into high-quality, stylized outputs. Implemented an end-to-end workflow with image captioning to enhance model accuracy, streamlining the creative process for enhanced visual content production.
Agent of Justice 
Engineered a courtroom simulation system called â€™Agent of Justiceâ€™ using large language models (LLMs), where one model orchestrated procedural flowâ€”deciding who speaks and what actions followâ€”while another generated contextual dialogue responses. Integrated the system into an interactive Gradio framework, enabling realistic legal proceedings and AI-driven role-play.
