## Machine Learning Projects
### LinkedIN Profile Generator
Developed a professional image generation pipeline using OstrisAI Toolkit and Stable Diffusion by transforming casual user images into high-quality, stylized outputs. Implemented an end-to-end workflow with image captioning to enhance model accuracy, streamlining the creative process for enhanced visual content production.
Agent of Justice 
Engineered a courtroom simulation system called â€™Agent of Justiceâ€™ using large language models (LLMs), where one model orchestrated procedural flowâ€”deciding who speaks and what actions followâ€”while another generated contextual dialogue responses. Integrated the system into an interactive Gradio framework, enabling realistic legal proceedings and AI-driven role-play.

### ContentCreator â€“ AI Marketing Content Creator
Participated in **Agents-MCP-Hackathon** by HuggingFace and Developed an **AI Marketing Content Creator** using Gradio and MCP (Model Context Protocol).  
Integrated multiple AI tools as modular functions on an MCP server, enabling dynamic tool invocation from the frontend. Implemented prompt generation using the Mistral API for crafting high-quality marketing & content text. Connected image generation tools (via HuggingFace/Flux1.dev) to create poster visuals optimized for different social media platforms based on prompts. Deployed the entire system on H200 GPU provided by **Modal Labs** for fast and scalable inference. Designed the architecture to be modular, allowing future multi-tool expansion without frontend changes. The app runs fully through dynamic tool calls, with no AI logic hardcoded in the UI layer.
